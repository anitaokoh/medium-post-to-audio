# Converting Medium Post to Audio using Polly

This project aimed to convert my old medium post to Audio using AWS Polly. This is the visual workflow breakdown 

The Medium post was extracted using Medium API, tranformed/cleaned and stored as clean text ready for AWS Polly text format.



After this process was achieved locally, it was further automated using Lamdba function. Here is the Visual work breakdown


Below is the AWS Polly output
